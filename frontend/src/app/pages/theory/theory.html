      <h3>Introduction to Topic</h3>
      <p>
        This is where the theory content will be displayed. For now, it's just a
        placeholder to demonstrate the page structure and styling, ensuring it
        matches the feel of the course list page.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can add more paragraphs, lists, and other content elements as needed.
      </p>
      <h3>Code Example</h3>
      <p>
        Code blocks will be an important part of the theory. Here is a
        placeholder for a code snippet:
      </p>

      <pre ngNonBindable><code>function greet(name) &#123;
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
&#125;

console.log(greet("Developer"));</code></pre>

      <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
      <p>
        More text explaining the key concepts of the topic would go here,
        maintaining the same typography and spacing.
